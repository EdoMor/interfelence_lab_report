\section{Discussion}
After examining the helix's diffraction pattern and deconstructing it to more familiar segments we were able to infer some of its' features.
Our error was large due to effects caused mainly by measuring method and we weren't able to completely reconstruct the helix from its diffraction pattern.
We have, however, shown that for a semi-translucent sample with typical size of $\lambda$ a reconstruction of its shape
is possible given that the distance from the screen is large enough the error in such reconstruction is proportional to the
size of the screen and most of the details lost due to the cutoff will effect the outer parameter of the shape.
We  would have continued this experiment by taking multiple pictures of the helix, prioritizing maximizing our focus,
and reconstruct the shape of a helix with higher accuracy.
