\section{Experimental technique and apparatus}
To examine the diffraction pattern from different slit patterns (and eventually a helix) we use the system described in Figure \ref{fig:Apparatus}.
\input{figures/Apparatus.tex}
Where the He-Ne laser produces an approximately monochromatic plane wave with $\lambda=632.8 [nm]$ and our sensor is at a fixed distance from the slits with $z=0.855 [m]$.
Both the angle $\theta$ and the Intensity $I$ were measured using resistors, the voltage on these resistors ($V\propto\theta,I$) was measured as a function of time.
First, we aligned the laser beam with the sensor by detecting the point of maximum intensity, then place the slits perpendicular to the beam.
This procedure is key to make sure our plain wave is reaching the slits with uniform phase and avoid major changes to our expected diffraction pattern.
The sensor was then moved to scan the intensities at some range of angles which were then converted to distances on our theoretical screen.
