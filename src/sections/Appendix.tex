\section{Appendix}
As can be seen in figure \ref{fig:single slit interference with 0.04mm width} the theory for a single slit fits the data well however there are
secondary effects easily observable in the tails of the data that per our understanding are partially caused by the non-linearity of the
photomultiplier and photoelectric sensor, such effects were not taken into account when formulating our theory
However the adjustment can be easily accomplished.
