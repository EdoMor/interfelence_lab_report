\section{Appendix}
For a sensor at a fixed distance $z=0.855 [m]$ from the screen.
The angle $\theta$ and the Intensity $I$ were measured using a resistor and a photodiod, the voltage on these resistors ($V\propto\theta,I$) was
measured at a rate of $40[Hz]$ and a resolution of $\Delta V\approx10^{-3}[V]$.
These are the interference patterns we measured:
