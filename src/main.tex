    \begin{abstract}
        An undergraduate laboratory module to study interference phenomena In the visible spectrum using variously shapes and a laser.
        The dependence of the interference pattern of the different shaped slits on the distance from the screen angle to the screen at a certain point and the wavelength were measured
        using a photoelectric sensor and a voltage Multiplier and were found to be consistent with The principles of interference on the the far field approximation.
